## 🪙 [Walletdps ton trc20](https://walletdps.netlify.app)

The wallet is **self-custodial and safe**. The developers **do not** have access to funds, browser history or any other information. We focus on **speed**, **size** and **attention to detail**. We try to avoid using third-party libraries to ensure maximum reliability and safety, and also to lower the bundle size.

## 🖥️ Linux Desktop Troubleshooting

**If the app does not start after click:**

Install the [FUSE 2 library](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE).

**If the app does not appear in the system menu or does not process ton:// and TON Connect deeplinks:**

Install [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) and install the AppImage file through it.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install appimagelauncher
```

**If the app does not connect to Ledger:**

Copy the udev rules from the [official repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules) and run the file `add_udev_rules.sh` with root rights.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules
cd udev-rules
sudo bash ./add_udev_rules.sh
```
